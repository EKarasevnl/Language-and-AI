# Usage guideline

In order to use the code, follow these 3 steps:

1. Open the notebook stylometry_all_together.ipynb.
2. Install the required modules by running the first line.
3. Run the "Source code" section to define the necessary functions.
4. Choose one of the 3 predefined sections (Political Inclination, Feeling/Thinking, Gender) or define your own config in the same way as other configs (e.g. config_political). Then, to see the BoW vs BoW + Stylometry comparison, run the subsections 'No Style SVM', 'No Style RF/XGB', 'Style SVM' and 'Style RF/XGB'. In case of custom config, simply copy those subsections from predefined and change the config name to the name of your custom config.
